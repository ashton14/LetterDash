LetterDash is a word game mobile app for Android that combines aspects from games like Scrabble and Anagrams,
but adds a twist: there is a time limit. The user must create as many words as possible containing each given
set of three letters. The user can choose between easy, normal, and hard mode and try to get the highest score possible.

Here is the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/BBrnfBtFz0u5hXCPM0Bl0f/LetterDash?node-id=0-1&t=ox8wtqAjWCD9Lt5D-1) for this project.

Letterdash uses this [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to check the validity of words.
